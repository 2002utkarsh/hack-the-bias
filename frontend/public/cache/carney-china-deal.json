      "content": "Israeli American Liat Beinin Atzili was taken captive during the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack. Over the next two months, her family members, including film director Brandon Kramer, tirelessly advocated for her release, an endeavor now documented in Kramer&#8217;s new film, <em>Holding Liat</em>. We speak to Atzili and Kramer about their family&#8217;s ordeal and Atzili&#8217;s captivity in Gaza, where she was held in isolation alongside another Israeli woman by members of Hamas until November 2023. &#8220;They kept telling us that they had no idea what was going on with other hostages, and that it was their job to keep us safe and to keep us healthy until we were released in a hostage deal. And that&#8217;s what they did,&#8221; she says. Since her release, Atzili has become a fierce advocate for peace and reconciliation. &#8220;There aren&#8217;t any conflicts that are unsolvable. It&#8217;s just a matter of people wanting to speak to each other and wanting to listen and to understand each other&#8217;s stories,&#8221; she says. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t do that, we&#8217;re just allowing violence to take over.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Holding Liat</em> premieres Friday, January 9, at Film Forum in New York, where <em>Democracy Now!</em> host Amy Goodman will <a href=\"https://filmforum.org/events/event/holding-liat-january-9\">moderate a Q&amp;A</a> with Liat Atzili and director Brandon Kramer.",

With investments across sectors like real estate, hospitality, media, cryptocurrency and more, the Trumps are &#8220;increasingly integrating their business empire&#8221; into the wider U.S. economy, says David Uberti, who has been reporting on the family&#8217;s self-enrichment for <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. The coupling of Trump&#8217;s economic and political influence is raising major questions about conflicts of interest. &#8220;You have all of these different business interests in different areas in which the government regulates,&#8221; and this &#8220;proximity to power may help along some of these deals and the valuations at which they&#8217;re made.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We look at the Trumps&#8217; cryptocurrency venture World Liberty Financial and the Trump Organization&#8217;s planned $6 billion merger with a firm hoping to build a nuclear fusion plant to power AI data centers with Uberti, who says such &#8220;very speculative, highly risky corners of financial markets&#8221; are key to the family&#8217;s investment strategy.",

With his claims of U.S. sovereignty over nations in the Western Hemisphere, &#8220;Trump&#8217;s basically saying, 'Well, this is ours, and China, Russia can have their spheres of influence.' And it is very 19th-century-esque. &#8217;Let&#8217;s divide up the world between the powers.&#8217;&#8221; This orientation is a major shift from U.S. foreign policy of recent decades, such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when interventionist actions were framed around ideological motivations, explains Hasan. &#8220;They said it was WMDs. They said it was democracy. They said it was al-Qaeda. They at least pretended that it wasn&#8217;t about the oil.&#8221; Meanwhile, Trump is brazen about his aims to seize control of Venezuela&#8217;s resources and demonstrate that &#8220;might is right.&#8221;",
