The film has since been shortlisted for an Oscar in the international feature category. Panahi dedicated a recent New York Film Critics Circle Award to Iranian protesters.</p>\n<p><em>It Was Just an Accident</em> centers on a group of former prisoners who kidnap a man they believe was their interrogator and grapple with whether to exact revenge, and Panahi says the film drew directly from his own experience with state violence and repression. Panahi has been repeatedly arrested in Iran, served prison sentences, and was recently sentenced in absentia to an additional year in prison and a two-year travel ban.</p>\n<p>In an extended interview, Pahani discussed the protests in Iran, fighting against censorship, and the risk of prolonged cycles of violence. &#8220;I have always said this regime will fall.

  "summary": "COMMON GROUND\nThe Iran crisis is characterized by significant internal unrest and protests. Both perspectives acknowledge that these protests are met with a forceful crackdown by the Iranian regime, resulting in a rising death toll. It is also recognized that the United States is involved in the situation through various means, including sanctions and statements regarding support for protesters, and that there is mutual condemnation between the Iranian leadership and U.S. officials.\n\nTHE CASE IN FAVOR\nThe narrative advocating for robust U.S. support to Iranians emphasizes that former President Trump has demonstrated 'unprecedented support' for the Iranian people. This perspective views the current Iranian leadership as a 'terror regime,' arguing for strong U.S. backing to facilitate its overthrow and the establishment of new leadership in the country.\n\nTHE CASE AGAINST\nCritics argue that the situation in Iran involves a complex interplay of internal repression and international dynamics. This narrative highlights reports of a significant death toll in ongoing protests, with some sources claiming thousands of fatalities and describing the situation as a 'genocide.' Concerns are also raised regarding the Iranian regime's alleged use of radioactive warheads against U.S. troops. While a desire for broader U.S. action against Iran's repression exists across the political spectrum, this perspective also points to the Iranian leadership's characterization of U.S. actions, particularly by former President Trump, as 'criminal,' asserting a need for accountability. The narrative also suggests that U.S. sanctions have contributed to an economic crisis, which in turn has seen protest death tolls rise amid an escalating crackdown. Furthermore, former President Trump's approach is described as unpredictable, with threats of military action that coincide with the regime's intensified efforts to suppress dissent. Some analyses also characterize U.S. actions in the region as 'aggression' contributing to a perceived 'empire in decline.'\n\nOBSERVATIONS ON EMPHASIS\nThe narrative advocating for robust U.S. support to Iranians primarily focuses on the characterization of the Iranian leadership as a 'terror regime' and highlights the necessity of U.S. backing for its replacement. Conversely, critics and those presenting a broader perspective emphasize the severe humanitarian consequences of the crackdown, specific allegations against the Iranian regime, the impact of U.S. sanctions on the economic crisis, and the Iranian leadership's own criticisms of the U.S. The internal dynamics of dissent and broader implications of U.S. foreign policy are also central to this view.",
